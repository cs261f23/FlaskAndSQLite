# A .gitignore file defines rules for files and directories that Git should
# ignore so that they don't accidentally get added to the repository. Things
# like virtual environments, IDE-specific files, generated Python bytecode,
# database files, and so on, are things that can be generated by the code or
# that are created by individual developers in ways that won't apply to all
# developers, so they will cause conflicts or needlessly inflate the size of
# the repository.

# Ignore a virtual environment. You may want to add other names like .venv/
# if different people on the team have differently named environments
venv/
# Ignore generated Python bytecode
__pycache__/
# Ignore all files with the extension .sqlite3 (database files)
*.sqlite3
# Ignore PyCharm and other Jetbrains IDE files
.idea/
